# kickstrap_rails for Rails 3.1+

Just a little gem that packages up [kickstrap](http://ajkochanowicz.github.com/Kickstrap/index.html) as a gem so you can easily add it to your Rails apps using the asset pipeline.

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

    gem "kickstrap_rails"

Add to your `application.js`:

    //= require kickstrap

Add to your `application.css`:

    //= require kickstrap

Also you can select theme:

    //= require kickstrap/themes/simplex

Then just [use kickstrap as normal](http://ajkochanowicz.github.com/Kickstrap/index.html).
